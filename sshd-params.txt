# Ciphers, are algorithms that define the way of data encryption after successfull authentication
# Only modern algorithms are used

Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-ctr

# MACs, Message Authentication Codes provide data integrity and authenticity over the session, prevents data tampering
# and packet injection attacks

MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256

# Key Exchange Algoritms, a way of defining a shared key that will be used by the ciphers to encrypt the session between
# 2 peers. a good algorithm prevents MITM, or guessing the session key.
# Remove the file /etc/ssh/moduli because diffie-hellman algorithms are not used.

# This conf defines the minimum length of the RSA key that SSH will offer. the default is 3072 which is weak for
